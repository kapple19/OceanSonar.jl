## Implementations

- [ ] Geographical, rectangular, and cylindrical 2D and 3D interpolations with conveniences methods.
  - Lower-dimensional symmetries applied for higher dimensional applications (e.g. the sound speed profile of an ocean eddy).
- [ ] 2D, 2.5D, and 3D ocean acoustic propagation models.
- [ ] Sonar equations for passive (narrowband, broadband, intercept) and active (monostatic, bistatic, multistatic) scenarios.
- [ ] Time-dependent simulations and performance analyses.

## Demonstrations

- Comparison of 2.5D propagation models with their 3D analogues.
- Error analysis of propagation models missing earth's curvature.
