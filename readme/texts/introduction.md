This [Julia] package is in development.

The purpose of this package is to implement ocean acoustics and sonar models.
Its goal is an open source community-developed acoustics package that enables:

* Performance like C++ and Fortran with legible syntax like MATLAB and Python.
* Distributed and parallel computing provided by Julia.
* Reproducibility of literature books and papers.
* Composability and modularity of models.
* Documented verbosities of mathematical results.
* Ease of collaboration.
* Code implementations that can be introspected mathematically, compiler-wise, and visualisation functionalities are built-in.
* Reliance and use of community-developed and tested equation solver libraries for differential equations, root finders, etc.

Motivations of the primary author:

* Mastery of field.
* Community engagement.
* Julia programming enjoyment and learning.
* Demonstration of Julia as next generation scientific software tool for analysis and deployment.
