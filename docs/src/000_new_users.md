```@contents
Pages = ["000_new_users.md"]

## New to the Field of Ocean Sonar

The field of ocean sonar encompasses the applications of acoustic dynamics
to sonar signal processing and detection in the ocean.

## New to Julia Programming

The Julia programming language boasts the speed of C++ and Fortran
with the accessibility of MATLAB and Python.
See the [creators' manifesto](https://julialang.org/blog/2012/02/why-we-created-julia/) on why they created Julia.

The [Julia language's main website](https://julialang.org/) provides links to many resources,
including their [documentation](https://docs.julialang.org/en/).

[Enterprise support](http://juliahub.com/) is also provided.

## New to this Package

As OceanSonar.jl is a Julia package, the Julia language is required.
Installation instructions are provided [here](https://julialang.org/downloads/).

Once Julia installed on your machine,
OceanSonar.jl is installed by Julia itself:

1. Open a Julia REPL (terminal).
2. Enter package mode by pressing the `]` key.
3. Enter `add OceanSonar`.
